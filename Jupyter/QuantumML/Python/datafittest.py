#Missing Values
#Most machine learning algorithms donâ€™t work well with missing values.
#There are three options of how we can fix this:
# - Get rid of the corresponding rows (removing the passengers from consideration)
# - Get rid of the whole column (remove the whole feature for all passengers)
# - Fill the missing values (for example with zero, the mean, or the median)

# option 1

# option 2
print('We only have very few information about the cabin, \nlet\'s drop it and all row related dropped too \n')

# option 3
# The age misses quite a few times. But intuition
# says it might be important for someone's chance to survive.
